        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p> . COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptoms can range from mild (or no
                symptoms) to
                severe illness. Some common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms can
                include
                fatigue,
                body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting,
                and
                diarrhea.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>. COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
                person
                coughs
                or sneezes. It’s also possible to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                and
                then
                touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>


            <p>. COVID-19 also spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that
                contain
                the
                virus.
                These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth.
                In
                some
                circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch so be aware of whatever you touch</p>


            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>. If you think you have COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you should get tested and
                stay
                home and
                away from others until you receive your test results. If you test positive for COVID-19, you should
                isolate
                yourself to
                prevent the spread of the virus. If you develop severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing or
                persistent
                chest
                pain,
                seek medical attention immediately.
                <br>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

            <p>Hello over there, we’ve created this website to make people more aware of coronavirus [covid-19], <br> we
                help
                them know whether they are infected by the virus of not by gathering some information <br> from them and
                testing
                it on a trained Machine Learning Model to get the result and tell them whether they are infected or not
